# Wordle Aid

> In process

An aid for playing Wordle.

Presently there is a branch that can be used to retrieve all of the
appropriate 5-letter words from the **WAmerican** word list available in Linux.

My copy is in `docs/words.txt`, and there is a PureScript script, `main`, in branch `master` that generates the 5-letter list.

Branch `main` contains the code for the actual aid.  I'm still working on it.
